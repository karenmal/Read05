Design web pages with CSS
CSS treats each HTML element like it is it's own box and the rulles you write will be applied and tells it how it shoulld look.
There are selectors - specify  the elements that the rule applies to, 
and declarations - that indicate what the elements should look like.
Declarations have two parts - properties of the element that you want to change and the values of those properties. 
CSS rules should be their own page and reference it in the HTML file.
